            Yes! Our challenges provide professional designs but there are no
            rules on what tools to use. So feel free to use anything you like to
            build your projects.

            The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
            Slack community. There are thousands of other developers in there,
            so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated
            "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can
            <a href="#">get an invite to our Slack community here.</a>

            Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your

            We don't provide "official" solutions for the challenges. This is
            because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge.
            Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the
            community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have
            approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.

            Frontend Mentor is a collaborative learning community where everyone
            can give feedback to each other. If you'd like to receive feedback
            from the community, please be sure to post a question when you
            submit your solution. The more specific you can be, the better.
            Being clear with your questions means you're much more likely to
            receive valuable feedback from others.

            We launch a new challenge every two weeks. We alternate between free

            premium challenge each month.
